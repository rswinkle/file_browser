file_browser
============

WIP structures and code to do file browsing/selection with standard features
like filtering based on extensions, sorting by name/size/modified, standard folders
bookmarks, recents, etc.  Meant to be adaptable for any GUI system.

The two demos are a terminal UI and a Nuklear GUI program.
